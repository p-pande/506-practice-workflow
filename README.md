# 506-practice-workflow
This is a primer for 504/507 Fall semester classes to practice a basic development workflow.

I created an integer variable, a string variable, a list, and a dictionary. 

The dictionary I created was about a student. It had a list of the student's hobbies and a nested dictionary that had the university name and the program.

I created a function that compares if two numbers are greater than or smaller than one another. 

When I inputted numbers 1 and 5 into the function, it printed out that 1 is smaller than 5 as expected. 

## For the given assignment, here was the output:

The assigned number is:  22

The assigned string is:  hello!

The list has the numbers:  [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]

This student's name is  Prabhakar and he is enrolled in  Masters in Applied Health Informatics

The result is:  1 is smaller than 5
